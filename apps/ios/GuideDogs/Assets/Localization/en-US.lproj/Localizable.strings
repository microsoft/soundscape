Furthermore, Soundscape’s value to you may evolve over time so how you use it today may differ from how you will use it in three months. People often think about apps in terms of \"what problem is this app good at solving?\" Soundscape certainly can be used on a case by case basis when you have a specific information need – such as keeping track of a destination as you make your way there, helping to orient yourself when you emerge from a metro station, getting your bearings when exiting a car, or finding the street names for, or distance to, the next intersection. However, the philosophy behind Soundscape is one of \"lighting up your world with sound\", designed to be used anytime you are out and about to provide ambient awareness of your surroundings, such as keeping you aware of the names of the streets you are on, the direction you are heading, and the names of businesses you are passing. In this use mode, our users have referred to Soundscape as a \"nice companion app\", which supports \"serendipity\", to \"fill in the gaps in your mental map\" and provide more \"confidence when walking\". Here are some other examples of how our users are incorporating Soundscape into their life:\n\n\"Soundscape helped me get back on track after I got off the bus and headed off in the wrong direction.\"\n\n\"Even in the town where I have lived for 3 years, I have built an improved picture of what is around me [with Soundscape].\"\n\n\"The 3D sound enhances my experience of a walk, as I feel more connected to my environment…I am more likely to try a new route now that I have the app to use.\"\n\n\"I miss the serendipity of walking around and noticing things. Having Soundscape is nice – it requires no effort to hear about things around me. The relational information is useful and is a great app for situational awareness and exploring commercial corridors.\"\n\n\"[I used Soundscape] to locate a pub in the middle of York. [I] used a range of its options to first locate and then actually find it. It took me to within 3 meters of the door – brilliant!\"";

"faq.how_to_use_beacon.answer" = "You can think of the audible beacon as a \"lighthouse for the ears\", notifying you of where your destination is relative to your location, as the crow flies. Like a lighthouse, it does not tell you how to get there – you may need to make many navigation choices along the way, just as a sailboat will have to make many strategic \"tacks\" to get closer to the lighthouse. The continuous rhythmic sound of the audible beacon is spatialized from the direction of the destination, and helps you stay aware of the location of the destination relative to you as you walk. When you are walking directly toward the destination, or you point the phone toward the destination, a higher pitched \"ring\" sound will be heard. This feature allows you to pinpoint the direction of the destination since the direction of the rhythmic sound can sometimes be difficult to perceive in loud environments. When searching for the higher pitched \"ring\", hold the phone flat and sweep the phone slowly; turning your head to point in the same direction of the phone will ensure that you have the best spatial audio experience.\n\nThe lighthouse metaphor for the beacon’s design has several natural implications:\n\n1. There is no \"correct\" direction to travel when using the beacon, instead, with Soundscape you choose how to get there;\n2. The higher pitched \"ring\" helps you pinpoint the direction of the destination only – it is not an indication of how you should get there;\n3. If you generally know how to get to your destination, you may wish to mute the beacon for the majority of your trip and turn it on only as you get closer to your destination.";
